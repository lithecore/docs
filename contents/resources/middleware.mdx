## Lithe Middlewares

Lithe offers several built-in middlewares:

| Middleware | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [Session](/resources/middleware/session) | Manages user sessions, allowing you to store and retrieve persistent information between requests, such as login data and preferences. |
| [Flash](/resources/middleware/flash) | Stores temporary messages to be displayed on the next request, useful for showing notifications and feedback on user actions such as form submissions or data changes. |
| [Csrf](/resources/middleware/csrf) | Protects against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks by ensuring that all requests originate from authenticated and authorized users, preventing unwanted actions on behalf of other users. |
| [Cors](/resources/middleware/cors) | Enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), allowing your application to accept requests from different origins and domains, which is essential for integrating with external APIs and communication between different web services. |

## Community Middlewares

In addition to the built-in middlewares, the Lithe community has also developed several useful middlewares:
