## Lithe Middlewares

Lithe provides various middlewares that can be integrated into your project to enhance its functionality. These middlewares are provided by default and can also be installed as additional packages as needed. Below is a list of some commonly used middlewares:

| Middleware | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [Cors](/resources/middleware/cors) | Enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), allowing your application to accept requests from different origins and domains, essential for integrating with external APIs and communication between different web services. |
| [Csrf](/resources/middleware/csrf) | Protects against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks by ensuring that all requests originate from authenticated and authorized users, preventing unwanted actions on behalf of other users. |
| [Flash](/resources/middleware/flash) | Stores temporary messages to be displayed on the next request, useful for showing notifications and feedback on user actions, such as form submissions or data changes. |
| [JWT Auth](https://github.com/lithephp/jwt-auth) | Implements authentication based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT), allowing secure user authentication in Lithe applications. This middleware can be installed via Composer and provides an efficient way to manage API authentication. |
| [Session](/resources/middleware/session) | Manages user sessions, allowing you to store and retrieve persistent information between requests, such as login data and preferences. |

## Community Middlewares

In addition to the middlewares developed by the Lithe team, the community has also created various useful middlewares. These community contributions offer additional functionalities and enhancements:
