## Lithe Middlewares

Lithe provides several middlewares created by the Lithe team that can be integrated into your project to enhance the functionality and efficiency of your application. Below is a list of some popular middlewares:

| Middleware | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [Cors](/resources/middleware/cors) | Enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), allowing your application to accept requests from different origins and domains, essential for integrating with external APIs and communication between different web services. |
| [Csrf](/resources/middleware/csrf) | Protects against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks, ensuring that all requests originate from authenticated and authorized users, preventing unwanted actions on behalf of other users. |
| [Flash](/resources/middleware/flash) | Stores temporary messages to be displayed on the next request, useful for showing notifications and feedback on user actions, such as form submissions or data changes. |
| [Session](/resources/middleware/session) | Manages user sessions, allowing you to store and retrieve persistent information between requests, such as login data and preferences. |

## Community Middlewares
