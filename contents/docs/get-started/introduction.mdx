## What is Lithe?

Lithe is a PHP framework known for its simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency. Inspired by Express.js, Lithe is designed to help developers build web applications quickly and effectively. The name "Lithe" reflects the framework's core characteristics: flexible and agile.
Here is a minimalist example:

```php
<?php
use App\Models\User;

$app = new \Lithe\App;

$app->get('/users/:id', function ($req, $res) {
    $id = $req->params->id;
    $user = User::find($id);
    
    if (!$user) {
        $res->status(404)->json([
            'error' => 'User not found'
        ]);
    } 

    $res->render('profile', compact('user'));
});

$app->listen();
```

This example demonstrates a Lithe application with a route to fetch and display a user based on the provided ID (`GET /users/:id`). If the user is not found, it returns a 404 error; otherwise, it displays the user's profile view.

## Simple and Flexible Routing

In Lithe, defining routes is very straightforward. You can use methods like `get()`, `post()`, and others to create routes that respond to different types of HTTP requests:

```php
$app->get('/hello/:name', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Hello, ' . $req->params->name);
});
```

Discover how [routing in Lithe](/docs/the-basics/routing) can simplify your development and give you full control over your application's routes.

## Powerful Middleware

In Lithe, middlewares are your line of defense, allowing you to inspect, filter, and manipulate HTTP requests before they reach the final routes. Imagine adding functionalities like authentication and logging in a modular and reusable way!

Hereâ€™s how easy it is to define and use middleware:

```php
// Middleware to check if the token is valid
$EnsureTokenIsValid = function ($req, $res, $next) {
    $token = $req->params->token;

    if ($token !== 'my-secret-token') {
        $res->send('Invalid token.');
    }

    $next();
};

// Protected route using the middleware
$app->get('/protected/:token', $EnsureTokenIsValid, function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Protected content accessed successfully!');
});
```

## Choosing a View Engine

Lithe offers flexibility by allowing you to choose between various template engines, such as plain PHP, Blade, and Twig. In addition to the default engines, you can configure others to optimize the creation and rendering of dynamic interfaces.

```php
$app->set('view engine', 'blade');
```

Explore the possibilities of [view engines](/docs/the-basics/template-engines) and learn how to integrate them into your project efficiently.

## Database Integration

Connecting to databases is simple with Lithe. The framework supports popular ORMs like Eloquent and native PHP drivers such as MySQLi and PDO. Configure your connections in the `.env` file and manage schema migrations easily.

```
DB_CONNECTION_METHOD=eloquent
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=lithe
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_SHOULD_INITIATE=true
```

---

## Database Migrations

Maintain data consistency and integrity in your applications with automated migrations. With Lithe, you can create and apply migrations quickly and easily, using any ORM or database driver interface.

```bash
php line make:migration CreateUsersTable --template=eloquent
php line migrate
```
