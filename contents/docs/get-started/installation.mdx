title: Lithe Installation  
description: Learn how to install Lithe in your development environment using Composer.  
---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine. If you donâ€™t have it, you can download and install it from the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">official Composer site</a>.

---

## Installation via Composer

To create a new Lithe project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
composer create-project lithephp/lithephp example-app
```

This will create a new directory called `example-app` and install Lithe along with all necessary dependencies.

---

## Environment Setup

After installation, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd example-app
```

### Web Server Configuration

To run your Lithe application, you can use PHP's built-in web server. Start the server with the following command:

```bash
php line serve
```

Now, your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Project Structure

The Lithe project generated by Composer will follow an organized structure that facilitates application development and maintenance. Here is an overview of the typical directory structure:

- **`src/`**: Contains all the components of the application.  
  - **`views/`**: Stores the template files used by the view engine.  
  - **`App.php`**: Main file where the application is configured and initialized.  
  - **`models/`**: Contains the models that represent the application's data structure.  
  - **`http/`**: Functionality related to the application's HTTP layer.  
    - **`controllers/`**: Controllers that handle HTTP requests and interact with the models.  
    - **`middleware/`**: Middleware functions that intercept and manipulate HTTP requests.  
  - **`database/`**: Includes database migrations and related configurations.  

- **`public/`**: Entry point for the web server.  
  - **`index.php`**: Initial file that directs all HTTP requests to the application.  
  
This structure clearly separates the responsibilities of the application, making it easier to organize and expand the project as it grows. Each directory has a specific purpose, ensuring a clean and modular architecture for efficient development.
