description: Learn how to install Lithe in your development environment using Composer.  
---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine. If you don’t have it, you can download and install it from the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">official Composer website</a>.

---

## Installation via Composer

To create a new Lithe project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
composer create-project lithecore/lithe example-app
```

This will create a new `example-app` directory and install Lithe along with all the necessary dependencies.

---

## Environment Configuration

After installation, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd example-app
```

### Web Server Configuration

To run your Lithe application, you can use PHP’s built-in web server. Start the server with the following command:

```bash
php line serve
```

Now, your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Project Structure

The Lithe project generated by Composer will follow an organized structure that facilitates the development and maintenance of the application. Here is an overview of the typical directory structure:

- **`src/`**: Contains the main source code of the application.
  - **`views/`**: Directory for storing the template files used by the view engine.
  - **`App.php`**: Main file where the application is configured and initialized.
  - **`models/`**: Models representing the data structure of the application.
  - **`database/`**: Contains database migrations and related configurations.
  - **`http/`**: HTTP layer-related functionalities.
    - **`controllers/`**: Controllers that handle HTTP requests and interact with models.
    - **`middlewares/`**: Middleware functions that intercept and manipulate HTTP requests.
- **`public/`**: Entry point for the web server.
  - **`index.php`**: Initial file that routes all HTTP requests to the application.

This structure clearly separates the application’s responsibilities, making it easier to organize and expand the project as it grows. Each directory has a specific purpose, ensuring a clean and modular architecture for efficient development.
