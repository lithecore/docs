## Logging Messages

Lithe automatically creates the `storage/logs` directory to store logs. Ensure that your application has the permissions to create and write files in this directory.

### Informative Messages

To log informative messages, use the `info` method:

```php
use Lithe\Support\Log;

$app->get('/hello/:name', function ($req, $res) {
    Log::info('Route /hello called with name: ' . $req->params->name);
    $res->send('Hello, ' . $req->params->name);
});
```

Informative messages help monitor the normal operation of the system and expected events.

### Warning Messages

To log warning messages, use the `warning` method:

```php
use Lithe\Support\Log;

$app->get('/warning-route', function ($req, $res) {
    Log::warning('Access to route /warning-route detected.');
    $res->send('Warning recorded.');
});
```

Warnings indicate conditions that are not errors but deserve attention.

### Error Messages

To log error messages, use the `error` method:

```php
use Lithe\Support\Log;

$app->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    try {
        // Code that may cause an error
        throw new Exception('Intentional error for example.');
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        Log::error('Error on route /: ' . $e->getMessage());
        $res->send('Error recorded.');
    }
});
```

Error messages are essential for identifying and fixing critical issues in the system.

## Log Storage

In addition to the logs you manually write, Lithe also automatically logs when something fails in your application. The logs are stored in specific files in the `storage/logs` directory:

- **`error.log`**: Critical error messages.
- **`warning.log`**: Warning messages.
- **`info.log`**: Informative messages.

These files help keep track of what is happening in the system and facilitate debugging and monitoring.
