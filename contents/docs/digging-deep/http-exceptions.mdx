## Defining Custom Handlers

To configure your application's response to specific HTTP errors, register handlers for the desired status codes using the `httpException` method on the Lithe application instance. This method takes two parameters: the HTTP status code (e.g., 404, 500) and a handler that receives the request and response objects as parameters. For 500 errors, there is an additional third parameter, the `exception`.

```php
// Handler for HTTP 400 (Bad Request)
$app->httpException(400, function($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Page not found.');
});

// Handler for HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error)
$app->httpException(500, function($req, $res, $exception) {
    $res->send('An internal error occurred.');
});
```

These handlers help ensure that your users receive clear and helpful messages when something goes wrong.

## Throwing HTTP Exceptions

Throwing HTTP exceptions is an effective way to generate specific error responses when your application encounters problems.

```php
use Lithe\Contracts\Http\HttpException;

$app->get('/some-route', function($req, $res) {
    // Throws an exception for error 404 (Not Found)
    throw new HttpException(404, 'Page not found.');
});
```

When an exception is thrown, Lithe will automatically look for a registered handler for the status code and execute the corresponding function.

Properly managing HTTP exceptions is essential for providing a consistent and informative user experience. By using Lithe's exception handlers and throwers, you can customize error responses and ensure that your users receive useful information in unexpected situations.
