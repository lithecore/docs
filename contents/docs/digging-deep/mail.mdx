## Configuring the Environment

Before using the `Mail` class, configure the environment variables in the `.env` file at the root of your project to set up email server settings:

```
MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=no-reply@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME=YourAppName
```

**Where:**

- **`MAIL_HOST`**: SMTP server address.
- **`MAIL_PORT`**: SMTP server port.
- **`MAIL_USERNAME`**: Username for SMTP server authentication.
- **`MAIL_PASSWORD`**: Password for SMTP server authentication.
- **`MAIL_ENCRYPTION`**: Encryption method for the SMTP connection (`tls` or `ssl`).
- **`MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`**: Sender's email address.
- **`MAIL_FROM_NAME`**: Sender's name.

These settings are necessary for the `Mail` class to connect to the SMTP server and send emails with the appropriate configurations.

## Using `Mail`

### Configuring the Email

To start using the `Mail` class, set the recipient of the email and optionally include the recipient's name. This can be done with the static `to` method:

```php
use Lithe\Support\Mail;

$mail = Mail::to('recipient@example.com', 'Recipient Name');
```

The `to` method sets the email recipient. The first parameter is the recipient's email address, and the second parameter is the recipient's name, which is optional.

### Adding CC and BCC Recipients

You can add CC (carbon copy) and BCC (blind carbon copy) recipients to the emails:

- **CC (Carbon Copy)**

  ```php
  $mail->cc('cc@example.com', 'CC Name');
  ```

  The `cc` method adds a recipient as CC. This means the recipient listed in CC will receive a copy of the email.

- **BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)**

  ```php
  $mail->bcc('bcc@example.com', 'BCC Name');
  ```

  The `bcc` method adds a recipient as BCC. BCC recipients are not visible to other recipients and will receive a copy of the email.

### Setting the Subject

After configuring the recipient, set the subject of the email using the `subject` method:

```php
$mail->subject('Email Subject');
```

The `subject` method sets the subject of the email. This is the title that will appear in the email's subject line.

### Setting the Body of the Email

You can choose to send the email body as plain text or HTML. Use the `text` method for plain text and `html` for HTML:

- **Plain Text**

  ```php
  $mail->text('This is the body of the email in plain text.');
  ```

  The `text` method sets the body of the email in plain text format. Ideal for emails without special formatting.

- **HTML**

  ```php
  $mail->html('<p>This is the body of the email in <strong>HTML</strong>.</p>');
  ```

  The `html` method sets the body of the email in HTML format, allowing for formatting and styling.

### Adding Attachments

To add attachments to the email, use the `attach` method. Provide the path to the file and the name of the attachment:

```php
$mail->attach('/path/to/file.pdf', 'File Name.pdf');
```

The `attach` method allows adding one or more files as attachments to the email. The first parameter is the file path, and the second is the name of the attached file.

### Adding Custom Headers

To add custom headers to the email, use the `addHeader` method:

```php
$mail->addHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'HeaderValue');
```

The `addHeader` method adds custom headers to the email. Custom headers can be used to include additional information or special settings in the email.

### Configuring the Reply-To Address

If you want to set a reply-to email address, use the `replyTo` method:

```php
$mail->replyTo('replyto@example.com', 'Reply To Name');
```

The `replyTo` method sets an email address for where replies to the email will be sent. The first parameter is the reply-to address, and the second is the associated name.

### Sending the Email

Finally, to send the email, use the `send` method. The method returns a boolean indicating whether the sending was successful:

```php
$sent = $mail->send();
```

The `send` method sends the configured email and returns `true` if the sending is successful or `false` if there is a failure.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while sending emails:

- **Check Settings**: Ensure that environment variables are correctly configured and that the SMTP server is accessible.
- **Check Logs**: If a failure occurs, the `Mail` class will log the error, which can be viewed in the system logs.
