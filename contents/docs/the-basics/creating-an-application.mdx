title: Creating an Application  
description: "Lithe allows you to create applications in a simple and versatile way, offering two writing styles: classic and functional. You can choose one of the two or even combine both, without losing efficiency!"  
---

## Classic Style: Instantiating the Application

To get started with the classic style, you'll need to mount the application in the `App.php` file using the `mount` method from the `Lithe\App` class. After that, simply define your routes:

```php
$app = \Lithe\App::mount();

$app->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Hello World!');
});
```

The `App` class is the heart of your Lithe application. It manages all the application logic, making it easy to create routes, handle requests, and responses in an organized way.

## Functional Style: Practicality and Agility

If you prefer a more minimalist approach, you can opt for the functional syntax without the need to directly instantiate the class:

```php
use function Lithe\Orbs\Http\Router\get;

get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Hello World!');
});
```

This method is quick, efficient, and allows you to write code in an even more concise manner.

## Running the Application

Now that you've written your first route, the next step is to run the application. If you're using the classic way, call the `listen` method for Lithe to start listening for requests:

```php
$app = \Lithe\App::mount();

$app->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Hello World!');
});

$app->listen(); 
```

With **Lithe 2**, this method is automatically invoked.

## Serving the Application

### Using the Built-in PHP Server

Testing your application locally is easy! With PHP installed, you can start the built-in server by executing the following command:

```bash
php line serve
```

This will start the server on port `8000`. To change the port, just pass the desired value as an argument:

```bash
php line serve 9000
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:9000/` to see your application in action!

### Using Web Servers like Apache

If you prefer to run your application on a web server like Apache, the entry point will be the `public` directory. Adjust the URL settings according to your environment:

- **Local Environment:** `http://localhost/your-project/public/`
- **Production:** `http://your-domain.com/`

Make sure the server is pointing to the correct directory and you're good to go! Your application will be available to the world.
