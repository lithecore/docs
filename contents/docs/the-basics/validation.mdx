## Quick Validation

Lithe includes a variety of validation rules ready to use on your data.

To better understand how validation works in Lithe, let's see a complete example of how to validate a form and show errors to the user. This practical guide will help you effectively validate your request data using Lithe.

### Defining Routes

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\PostController;

$app = new \Lithe\App;

$app->route('/post/create')
    ->get([PostController::class, 'create'])
    ->post([PostController::class, 'store']);

$app->listen(); 
```

The GET route displays a form for the user to create a new blog post, while the POST route saves the post to the database.

### Creating the Controller

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Lithe\Contracts\Http\Request;
use Lithe\Contracts\Http\Response;

class PostController
{
    /**
     * Shows the form to create a new blog post.
     */
    public static function create(Request $req, Response $res)
    {
        return $res->view('post.create');
    }

    /**
     * Stores a new blog post.
     */
    public static function store(Request $req, Response $res)
    {
        // Validate and store the blog post...
    }
}
```

### Writing the Validation Logic

Now let's fill in the `store` method with the necessary logic to validate the new blog post. We will use the `validate` method available on the HTTP request object. This method requires one parameter: `$rules`, which defines the validation rules for specific fields.

The `validate` method returns an object with two methods: `passed`, which returns a boolean indicating whether all data is correct according to the defined rules, and `errors`, which is an array listing the fields that failed validation along with their respective error codes.

To better understand how to use the `validate` method, see the example in the `store` method:

```php
/**
 * Stores a new blog post.
 */
public static function store(Request $req, Response $res)
{
    $validate = $req->validate([
        'title' => 'required|max:255',
        'body' => 'required',
    ]);

    if (!$validate->passed()) {
        $errors = $validate->errors();
        
        foreach ($errors as $field => $code) {
            switch ($code) {
                case 1001:
                    // Handle required field error
                    break;
                case 1010:
                    // Handle max length error for 'title'
                    break;
                // Add more cases as needed
            }
        }
    }

    // Continue with storing the post if validation passes...

    return $res->redirect('/posts');
}
```
